          <h3>2.1</h3>
          <p>You may choose to pay for the care companion services by online banking, credit card, and or debit card ("Card") at the payment platform made available by the Company.

          <h3>2.2</h3>
          <p>In the event that you choose to pay for the care companion services by Card, you will need to register a valid Card that belongs to you in accordance with the instructions within the Application.</p>

          <h3>2.3</h3>
          <p>If the Card belongs to another person, such as your parents, you hereby warrant and agree that you have obtained their permission to use the Card for the payment of the care companion services.</p>

          <h3>2.4</h3>
          <p>You agree that we may verify and authorize your Card details when you first register the Card with us as well as when you use the Service.</p>

          <h3>2.5</h3>
          <p>You agree that we may issue a reasonable authorization hold, which is not an actual charge against your Card, in order to verify your payment method via your Card. The hold may appear in your statement as "pending". The authorization hold is issued as a preventive measure against any unauthorized or fraudulent usage of your Card.</p>

          <p>In the event your payment by your Card is processed overseas, you will be liable for any additional charges in relation thereto.</p>

          <h3>2.6</h3>
          <p>All payments must be made upon confirmation of booking and before the Temanion performs the care companion service.

          <h3>2.8</h3>
          <p>The Company reserves the right to suspend the processing of any transaction or disable or limit the use of the Card in the event of any error in the transaction that results in decline or chargeback from the financial institution or where the Company reasonably believes that the Card has been used for a transaction that may be fraudulent, illegal or involves any criminal activity or where the Company reasonably believes you to be in breach of the Terms of Use.</p>

          <h3>2.9</h3>
          <p>You agree that you will cooperate in relation to any financial crime screening that is required and to assist the Company in complying with any prevailing laws or regulations in place.</p>

          <p>Any service cancellation must be submitted in writing at least seven (7) days prior to the scheduled service date. In such cases, the Company will refund eighty percent (80%) of the total amount paid. The remaining twenty percent (20%) will be retained to cover administrative and processing costs already incurred.</p>

          <h3>3.2</h3>
          <p>For payments made via credit card, an additional three percent (3%) will be deducted from the refundable amount. This deduction reflects the non-refundable processing fee imposed by our payment gateway provider.</p>

          <h3>3.5</h3>
          <p>Additionally, the Company may, at its sole discretion, cancel transactions that are suspected to be fraudulent, unlawful, or in violation of our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, or policies on prohibited items.</p>
